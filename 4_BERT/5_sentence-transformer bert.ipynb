    "Learn to extract sentence vectors from BERTModel in the sentence-transformer package. Use different machine learning classifiers on the feature vectors.\n",

    "As seen from the bertmodel.ipynb tutorial, we can access the sentence vectors, called _last_hidden_state_ in BERTModel. However, because working with the model is extremely computationally intensive, we would require the use of GPUs. The question now becomes, what if you do not have access to GPUs? Is there a more lightweight approach to the problem? Well there is. In this tutorial, we will discuss the usage of sentence-transformer and the Bert model within it. It is more agile and do not require the use of GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository, we have see how to work with BERT: using BERTmodel in the transformer package, using the powerful BertForSequenceClassification and lastly, using the sentence-transformer package. We will explore this last method in this notebook. \n",

    "First, we need to set up the environment in Google Colab - we need to download the libraries that is not available in Colab"

Not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy.

       "1  A film that tends to get buried under prejudice and preconception - It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack at 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' is his most under-rated film, and arguably a fully fledged masterpiece in its own right.<br /><br />This is, in more ways than one, Doris Day's film. Not only does she give the finest performance of her career, more than holding her own against James Stewart, but the whole film is subtly structured around her character rather than his. This is, after all, a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: Day's Jo McKenna has given up her career on the stage in order to settle down with her husband and raise their son. This seems to be a mutual decision, and she doesn't appear to be unhappy. But look at the way Stewart teases her in the horse-drawn carriage over her concerns about Louis Bernard, implying that she is jealous that Berna...   \n",

Now, when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching \"Teen News\" -- you know, that kids' news show, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. If they are reviewing a non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it \"confusing\". Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids.

However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced. Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.   \n",

An embittered, \"Spike\"-type youth (McAvoy) with Deuchennes MD is placed in a home for the disabled and quickly makes friends with a youth (Robertson) with cerebral palsy. Robertson has never known anything outside of the home, but McAvoy has and he is bound and determined to get back into the real world. Together, they manage to do just that in this funny and heartwarming and often heartbreaking tale of inner strength overcoming physical shortcomings. The two leads are terrific, especially Robertson, who must surely have spent some time studying the disabled to pull off this tricky role. He appears in almost every scene, and acts up an absolute storm. To anyone who doesn't know, they might think he really has CB. Highly recommended.   \n",
       "2737   ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** THE CELL / (2000) **** (out of four)<br /><br />\"Do you believe there is a part of yourself, deep inside in your mind, with things you don't want other people to see? During a session when I'm inside, I get to see those things.\"<br /><br />--Catherine Deane<br /><br />And so do we. One of the most visually stimulating films of the year, \"The Cell\" is a love/hate movie-either you love it or you hate it. I can understand the reasons some people dislike this production. With a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind-probing, \"The Cell\" is too much for some viewers; others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film. I think it's one of the year's most engrossing films.<br /><br />Making his feature film screenwriting debut, Mark Protosevich creates an imaginative world of rich, colorful images and provocative characters. The filmmakers take advantage of every shot. Protosevich conceived ideas for \"The Cell\" in 1993 whe...   \n",

Oh....where to start....<br /><br />Plot (what little there is): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire, with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant. Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother's PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba.

Apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). In those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it.

Now, when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching \"Teen News\" -- you know, that kids' news show, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. If they are reviewing a non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it \"confusing\". Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids.

Because we are not using GPU, we are relying completely on CPU compute to access the sentence vectors. In our case, for 3000 lines of text, it takes about 16 minutes to return the sentence embeddings.\n",
